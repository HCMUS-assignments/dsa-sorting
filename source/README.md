                j = j - gap
            a[j + gap] = x

### :six: Heap Sort
#### I. Algorithm:
    1. Build a max heap from the input data.
    2. At this point, the largest item is stored at the root of the heap. Replace it with the last item of the heap followed by reducing the size of heap by 1. Finally, heapify the root of the tree.
    3. Repeat step 2 while size of heap is greater than 1.

#### II. Complexity:

    heapify(a, n, i)
    largest = i
    l = 2 * i + 1
    r = 2 * i + 2
    if l < n and a[l] > a[largest]
        largest = l
    if r < n and a[r] > a[largest]
        largest = r
    if largest != i
        swap a[i] and a[largest]
        heapify(a, n, largest)

### :seven: Merge Sort
#### I. Algorithm:
    1. If the list is empty or has one item, it is sorted.
    2. Divide the list recursively into two halves until it can no more be divided.
    3. Merge the smaller lists into new list in sorted order.

#### II. Complexity:
    - Time complexity: O(nlogn)
    - Space complexity: O(n)

#### III. Pseudocode:
    mergeSort(a, l, r)
    if l < r
        m = (l + r) / 2
        mergeSort(a, l, m)
        mergeSort(a, m + 1, r)
        merge(a, l, m, r)

    merge(a, l, m, r)
    n1 = m - l + 1
    n2 = r - m
    L[1..n1], R[1..n2]
    for i = 1 to n1
        L[i] = a[l + i - 1]
    for j = 1 to n2
        R[j] = a[m + j]
    i = 1
    j = 1
    for k = l to r
        if L[i] <= R[j]
            a[k] = L[i]
            i = i + 1
        else
            a[k] = R[j]
            j = j + 1

### :eight: Quick Sort
#### I. Algorithm:
    1. Pick an element, called a pivot, from the list.
    2. Reorder the list so that all elements with values less than the pivot come before the pivot, while all elements with values greater than the pivot come after it (equal values can go either way). After this partitioning, the pivot is in its final position. This is called the partition operation.
    3. Recursively apply the above steps to the sub-list of elements with smaller values and separately to the sub-list of elements with greater values.

#### II. Complexity:
    - Time complexity: O(nlogn)
    - Space complexity: O(nlogn)

#### III. Pseudocode:
    quickSort(a, l, r)
    if l < r
        p = partition(a, l, r)
        quickSort(a, l, p - 1)
        quickSort(a, p + 1, r)

    partition(a, l, r)
    pivot = a[r]
    i = l - 1
    for j = l to r - 1
        if a[j] <= pivot
            i = i + 1
            swap a[i] and a[j]
    swap a[i + 1] and a[r]
    return i + 1

### :nine: Counting Sort
#### I. Algorithm:
    1. Find the largest element in the array.
    2. Create a count array of size equal to the largest element and initialize it with all zeros.
    3. Store the count of each element at its respective index in count array.
    4. Find cumulative sum of elements in the count array.
    5. Find the index of each element of the original array in the count array. This gives the cumulative count.
    6. Place the element at the index calculated in step 5 in the output array.
    7. Reduce the count by 1 for each index calculated.

#### II. Complexity:
    - Time complexity: O(n+k)
    - Space complexity: O(n+k)

#### III. Pseudocode:
    countingSort(a, n)
    max = findMax(a, n)
    count[0..max]
    output[1..n]
    for i = 0 to max
        count[i] = 0
    for i = 1 to n
        count[a[i]] = count[a[i]] + 1
    for i = 1 to max
        count[i] = count[i] + count[i - 1]
    for i = n downto 1
        output[count[a[i]]] = a[i]
        count[a[i]] = count[a[i]] - 1
    for i = 1 to n
        a[i] = output[i]

### :keycap_ten: Radix Sort
#### I. Algorithm:
    1. Find the maximum number to know number of digits.
    2. Do counting sort for every digit. Note that instead of passing digit number, exp is passed. exp is 10^i where i is current digit number.
    3. The idea of Radix Sort is to do digit by digit sort starting from least significant digit to most significant digit. Radix sort uses counting sort as a subroutine to sort.

#### II. Complexity:
    - Time complexity: O(nk)
    - Space complexity: O(n+k)

#### III. Pseudocode:
    radixSort(a, n)
    m = findMax(a, n)
    for exp = 1 to m
        countingSort(a, n, exp)

    countingSort(a, n, exp)
    output[1..n]
    count[0..9]
    for i = 0 to 9
        count[i] = 0
    for i = 1 to n
        count[(a[i] / exp) % 10] = count[(a[i] / exp) % 10] + 1
    for i = 1 to 9
        count[i] = count[i] + count[i - 1]
    for i = n downto 1
        output[count[(a[i] / exp) % 10]] = a[i]
        count[(a[i] / exp) % 10] = count[(a[i] / exp) % 10] - 1
    for i = 1 to n
        a[i] = output[i]

### :one: :one: Flash Sort
#### I. Algorithm:
    1. Find the minimum and maximum values in the array.
    2. Calculate the m value using the following formula: m = (n * alpha) / (max - min)
    3. Create a new array of size m and initialize it with zeros.
    4. Iterate over the array and calculate the index of each element using the following formula: index = (array[i] - min) * m / (max - min)
    5. Increment the value at the index calculated in step 4.
    6. Iterate over the new array and calculate the cumulative sum.
    7. Iterate over the array in reverse order and calculate the index of each element using the following formula: index = (array[i] - min) * m / (max - min)
    8. Place the element at the index calculated in step 7 in the output array.
    9. Reduce the count by 1 for each index calculated.

#### II. Complexity:
    - Time complexity: O(n)
    - Space complexity: O(n)

#### III. Pseudocode:
    flashSort(a, n)
    max = findMax(a, n)
    min = findMin(a, n)
    m = (n * alpha) / (max - min)
    l[m]
    for i = 0 to m
        l[i] = 0
    for i = 0 to n - 1
        index = (a[i] - min) * m / (max - min)
        l[index] = l[index] + 1
    for i = 1 to m
        l[i] = l[i] + l[i - 1]
    for i = n - 1 downto 0
        index = (a[i] - min) * m / (max - min)
        output[l[index]] = a[i]
        l[index] = l[index] - 1
    for i = 0 to n - 1
        a[i] = output[i + 1]
